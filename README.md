## End-to-End Algorithmic Trading System

This repository contains key modules from a full-cycle, high-frequency algorithmic trading system I architected and built from the ground up. The system is designed to be a robust, production-grade application that handles everything from real-time data ingestion and feature engineering to model training, backtesting, and automated trade execution.

The project demonstrates a comprehensive skill set in Python, data engineering, machine learning (with Keras/TensorFlow), and DevOps on a cloud-native stack.

## System Architecture

The system is designed as a decoupled, event-driven pipeline orchestrated via Google Cloud Pub/Sub. This architecture ensures scalability, resilience, and maintainability.
